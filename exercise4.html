        The film tells the story of Ali (Aguilera), an aspiring singer who
        leaves her small hometown for Los Angeles, where she becomes a dancer at
        a struggling burlesque lounge owned by Tess (Cher). After a performance
        is sabotaged by her rival, Nikki (Bell), Ali sings the song herself,
        impressing Tess and leading to her becoming the main attraction of the
        lounge. Burlesque marks Aguilera's first leading role, as well as Cher's
        first musical performance on screen.
